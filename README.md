# Quinn's Tweeter Project

A simple, single-page Twitter clone built using jQuery, AJAX, HTML5, and CSS to hone my skills as a web developer on the front-end! All styles are written with SASS, and are compiled automatically at server launch. Written as part of Lighthouse Labs' web-developer bootcamp.

Built to be responsive! The website takes on one of two layouts, depending on the width of the display. Also tracks the current scroll position and uses it to toggle visibility between two buttons that open and focus a tweet-composing form.
